Abstract description of each data structure in the software along with 
a description of how it is used.

User:
	Name: String representing the users profile in the system
	Constructor:expects a users name
	updateMeme(memeName, favor): function of the class that expects a meme name and favor
					if there is no meme set for the user one is defaulted at either 1 or -1
					depending on the users preference for the meme, via the property accessor
					
					if a meme does exist in the user profile, then all we do is increment or decrement
					depending on their selection
					
					for an example of how the javascript property accessor works go here:
					https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors
					
	Notes:Meme attributes for the user are dynamically created via the "updateMeme" function
		  and can be accessed something like this userName["memeName"] and that should return the value we want
	
Meme:
	Name: The name of the Meme
	Picture: The meme's picture as an image file
	Notes: This should really be a very simple data structure to send and get. 
		   All it was really made for is encapsulating the meme data for the user
